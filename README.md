# cowsay Discord Bot
This is a discord bot that will basically act as cowsay does on unix apps. Just put 'cowsay' in front of the text and it will print it out as a cow.

#### [Add cowsay to your server.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=799105431691460699&scope=bot&permissions=10240 "Add cowsay to your server.")

### Known Issues

- sending \`\`\` will close the code box causing it to look strange

### Future Goals
- use slash commands
- have different animals and be able to customise the cow
- actually write good code

### Disclaimer
This is just a fun joke, the code is absolute garbage. I don't even know js so this is just a way for me to learn a bit of node. This will probably break and do strange things. If you find a bug, go ahead and open an issue.
